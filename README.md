# Words Frequency in IDs

This repository contains a Python notebook for analyzing word frequency in a list of IDs. The notebook segments concatenated words in IDs and calculates their frequency, providing a detailed analysis of word usage within the given data set.

## Features

- **Word Segmentation:** Automatically segments concatenated words (e.g., `booklover` -> `book`, `lover`).
- **Frequency Analysis:** Calculates the frequency of each segmented word.
- **ID Mapping:** Maps each word to the IDs that contain it.

## Usage

1. **Load Your Data:** Place your list of IDs in the notebook.
2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the notebook to perform word segmentation and frequency analysis.
3. **Review the Results:** View the frequency of words and the corresponding IDs.

## Installation

To use the notebook, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed:

`pip install nltk wordsegment pandas`
